    Performs a deep copy of obj recursively, using path to track the current

    Args:
        obj (object): An iterable object that will be traversed.
        path (list):  A list consisting of parent key nodes from the 
            current position, and also tuple(s) of position and length 
            when traversing a list.

            For instance::
                path = ["key", (0, 2), "nested_key"]
                obj = {"key":[

        callback (callable): An optional function that is called for each
            each iteration.
            This function takes 3 arguements; path, value (at current pos) and
            kwargs.
        **kwargs:  Any additional attributes to pass to the callback function.
    Returns:
        object: The deep-copy result of obj, or a modified version if applying 
        a callback function.
